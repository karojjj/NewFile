        Move Zeros
Write a program that will move all the zero numbers to the end of the array.
The rest of the numbers will move over in position
Hint: You donâ€™t have to manipulate the given array, try to use another array too. Think
about the indexes
Ex:
Input:
[10, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]
Output:
[10, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0]
