Types of Selenium waits:
Implicit wait: it tells the webdriver to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception
it will only be written once and will be applied to the whole session of the execution
 we can sy that implicit wait is a global wait
Implicit wait is usually set to 20 seconds.if your element is found in any time between the given time the remaining time
will be ignored and your script will move on to the next line or action
